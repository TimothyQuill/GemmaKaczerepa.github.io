        Hi, hello, I’m so glad you’re here!
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’m Gemma – a freelance writer with oodles of experience across all kinds of industries, all kinds of businesses and all kinds of content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enough about me, though. Let’s figure out why you’re here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your website looks great, but the copy doesn’t</li>
        <li>You want to engage your customers, but you’re not sure what to say (or how to say it)</li>
        <li>You’ve got a product, but no clear voice or message to sell it</li>
        <li>You know you need words of some kind, but you’re stuck on where to start</li>
        <li>You thought you were clicking on an ad for ??</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Well, you’re in the right place.
      </p>
      <h3>I can help with:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Website copy that sounds exactly like you: clear, compelling and true to your brand</li>
        <li>Blog posts and articles that build trust and give your readers a solid reason to stick around</li>
        <li>Email sequences designed to boost opens and clicks (and maybe the odd share)</li>
        <li>Thought-leadership pieces that position you as an expert</li>
        <li>Marketing materials and ads crafted to get you noticed</li>
        <li>Social media copy that stands out in the never-ending scroll</li>
        <li>Overall content strategy so you know what to write, when and why</li>
        <li>Getting you back to that ?? you were looking for</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      <h3>On a budget?</h3>
      <p>
        Before you go nuts generating pages of AI content, let’s talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realise AI has its place; it’s fast, it’s easy and it’s entirely free. But when you let AI play content manager without a human lens, things get dicey.
      </p>
      <p>
        You risk sharing stuff that’s off-brand, full of mistakes, overuses words like ‘delve’ and ‘tapestry’, and is just plain boring.
      </p>
      <p>
        You wouldn’t want your audience to lose trust in your business or fall asleep halfway through your ‘About’ page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where a human editor (me!) comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer AI-assisted content that’s totally on-brand, factually correct, fun to read and ‘tapestry’-free – so you can stick to your budget and rest easy knowing what you’re putting out there is top-notch.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Don’t worry – if you’re paying me to write copy from scratch, I’ll never cheat with AI and pass it off as my own!)
